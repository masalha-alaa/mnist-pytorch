# Digit Classification with PyTorch (MNIST)
A simple neural network (NN) that I wrote in PyTorch to classify images of hand written digits (MNIST dataset).

The NN simply consists of 2 fully connected layers.

The complete Jupyter notebook [MNIST_with_PyTorch.ipynb](https://github.com/masalha-alaa/mnist-pytorch/blob/master/MNIST_with_PyTorch.ipynb) can be found in the root directory, with a link to the source code in Google Colab.
